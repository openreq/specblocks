*open source software specification building blocks*

This project aims to share building blocks for software specifications we have found useful in our projects. Writing a good specification is always a lot of work. Sometimes it helps to have samples from other projects as a starting point.


ccuireq - Cross-cutting UI-Requirements
--------------------------------------

The first sample is a specification for cross-cutting user interface requirements. We have found that often it helps to centralise the user interface requirements that are not specific to a single screen or dialogue in a single document, as the project grows. This helped us to improve consistency and find possibilities for re-use.

The document is written in pandoc-flavoured markdown, from which any format supported by [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) can be created. We provide HTML, Word and PDF-versions for convenience.
